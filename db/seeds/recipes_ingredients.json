It is certainly not nuoc mam but I don't know if it contains it. It is rather hot and by flavor I would guess it comes from the northern provinces - perhaps NE end of China. I have also had it with fresh pork strings. Glorious. Do you have any idea what it is or a recipe??? I have been unable to find it anywhere in my Chinese library.

Allow the eggplant to drain in the sink for a minimum of 30 minutes but you can allow to sit longer while you prepare the sauce.</li><li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a saucepan or skillet over medium heat.  Add in the garlic and pinch of hot pepper flakes (if using). Cook until garlic is fragrant being careful to not let brown  about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Add in the diced tomatoes.  Allow the sauce to come to a simmer. Cook until the tomatoes break down and the sauce thickens  - about 20 minutes. (Allow the sauce to become thick and chunky so the finished dish is not too watery.) Once thickened, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Chiffonade a few basil leaves (roll lengthwise and cut into little slices.) Stir to combine. Taste and adjust any seasonings.</li><li>Roast the eggplant:  While the sauce is cooking, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.  Lightly coat 2 sheet pans with olive oil. Rinse and dry the eggplant slices. Lay the slices on the pan and brush he tops with additional olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and freshly ground pepper.  Bake until soft and golden, about 20 minutes. Check half way through and turn slices. Remove from oven. Allow to cool until possible to handle. Maintain oven temperature.</li><li>Assemble and bake:  In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom. Layer about 1/3 of the eggplant slices over the tomato sauce.  Spread with another thin layer of tomato sauce. Sprinkle with about 1/3 of the mozzarella and a dusting of Parmigiano. Repeat with the remaining eggplant, tomato sauce and cheeses. I give the top an extra dusting of Parmigiano.  Bake until the cheese has melted and the sauce is nice and bubbly, about 25 minutes.</li><li>Allow the dish to rest for about 15 minutes before serving.

Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Reduce to heat to low and simmer for 10 min so the flavors of the herbs can be drawn out. Pour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water.  Set aside.</li><li>Clean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface.  Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients, because no one is a fan of salmonella!  Place the chicken in the brine,  make sure it is completely immersed in the brine.  Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour and up to 6 hours.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 375F.</li><li>Remove the chicken from the brine and place on a clean surface.  Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel as shown.  Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket.  Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh  this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat.  Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.</li><li>Bake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes.  To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F.  If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked.  Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.</li><li>Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes.  This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board.  To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints.  Remove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way.  To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage.  Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints.  You can choose to serve the breasts whole or cut them into thin slices.</li></ol>","image_url":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/Herb-Roasted-Chicken-646673.jpg","original_id":646673,"source_url":"http://www.foodista.com/recipe/HQ8GR7BT/herb-roasted-chicken"},"ingredients":[{"name":"bay leaves","food_type":"Spices and Seasonings","quantity":2.0,"unit":""},{"name":"brown sugar","food_type":"Baking","quantity":0.3333333333333333,"unit":"cup"},{"name":"butter","food_type":"Milk, Eggs, Other Dairy","quantity":1.0,"unit":"stick"},{"name":"coarse black pepper","food_type":"Spices and Seasonings","quantity":1.0,"unit":"tablespoon"},{"name":"dried basil","food_type":"Spices and Seasonings","quantity":0.5,"unit":"teaspoon"},{"name":"dried rosemary","food_type":"Spices and Seasonings","quantity":1.0,"unit":"tablespoon"},{"name":"dried thyme","food_type":"Spices and Seasonings","quantity":1.0,"unit":"tablespoon"},{"name":"fennel seeds","food_type":"Spices and Seasonings","quantity":1.0,"unit":"tablespoon"},{"name":"ice","food_type":"Frozen","quantity":6.0,"unit":"cups"},{"name":"kosher salt","food_type":"Spices and Seasonings","quantity":6.0,"unit":"servings"},{"name":"water","food_type":"Beverages","quantity":4.0,"unit":"cups"},{"name":"whole chicken","food_type":"Meat","quantity":3.0,"unit":"lb"}],"classifications":["Gluten-Free","Dairy-Free"]},{"recipe":{"title":"Baked Chicken Dijon","cook_time":45,"servings":6,"method":"<ol><li>Preheat oven to 350 F.
